        This important piece of information tells us why we need to avoid a JavaScript-based solution that moves elements based on scroll events: JavaScript doesn’t guarantee that parallaxing will keep in step with the page’s scroll position. In older versions of Mobile Safari scroll events were actually delivered at the end of the scroll, which made it impossible to make a JavaScript-based scroll effect. More recent versions do deliver scroll events during the animation, but, similarly to Chrome, on a "best-effort" basis. If the main thread is busy with any other work, scroll events will not get delivered immediately, meaning the parallax effect will be lost.

        Bad: updating background-position
      </h1>
      <p>
        Another situation we’d like to avoid is painting on every frame. Many solutions attempt to change background-position to provide the parallax look, which causes the browser to repaint the affected parts of the page on scroll, and that can be costly enough to significantly jank the animation.

        If we want to deliver on the promise of parallax motion, we want something that can be applied as an accelerated property (which today means sticking to transforms and opacity), and which doesn’t rely on scroll events.

        Both Scott Kellum and Keith Clark have done significant work in the area of using CSS 3D to achieve parallax motion, and the technique they use is effectively this:
      </p>

      <p>Set up a containing element to scroll with overflow-y: scroll (and probably overflow-x: hidden).</p>
      <p>To that same element apply a perspective value, and a perspective-origin set to top left, or 0 0.</p>
      <p>To the children of that element apply a translation in Z, and scale them back up to provide parallax motion without affecting their size on screen.</p>
